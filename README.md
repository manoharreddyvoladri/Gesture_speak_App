# GestureSpeak: Bridging Communication Gaps with AI-Powered Sign Language Translation and Real-Time Video Conferencing

## **Overview**
GestureSpeak is an AI-powered platform designed to provide real-time sign language detection and translation. This application bridges communication gaps by integrating advanced deep learning models with a user-friendly interface. The system processes live video streams, detects sign language using YOLOv5, and translates it into text in real-time.

---

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Sign Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for detecting and interpreting sign language with high accuracy.
- **Video Conferencing**: Supports seamless communication between users.
- **Secure Authentication**: Provides OTP-based secure user authentication.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Features a clean, professional UI for easy navigation.
- **Low Latency**: Enables real-time interaction with minimal delay.
